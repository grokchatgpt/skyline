# Context Truncation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
- External request processor was receiving full conversation array instead of just latest message pairs
- Skyline's 3-message truncation system was broken and bypassing the context management framework
- Message ordering was incorrect: `[system, assistant, user]` instead of proper `[system, user, assistant]`
- Context history updates (duplicate file read notices, truncation notices) were not being applied
- **CRITICAL**: Assistant message logic was flawed - looking for assistant message immediately after user message instead of finding the most recent assistant message independently

## Root Cause
The `getAndAlterTruncatedMessages` method in `ContextManager.ts` had a "brutal edit" that:
1. **Ignored the `deletedRange` parameter** - Breaking integration with other components
2. **Bypassed context history updates** - Missing duplicate file read notices and truncation markers
3. **Used wrong message ordering** - Created invalid conversation structure
4. **Didn't respect the existing framework** - Other components couldn't track truncation state

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the `getAndAlterTruncatedMessages` method to implement a proper **3-message system** within the existing framework:
1. **System message** - Contains bot instructions and capabilities (essential)
2. **Latest user message** - Current user input (essential)  
3. **Latest assistant message** - Most recent bot response (if exists)

## Key Changes Made
- **Fixed message ordering**: Now returns `[system, user, assistant]` in correct conversation order
- **Fixed assistant message logic**: Now finds the most recent assistant message independently, not just the one after the user message
- **Added `applyContextHistoryUpdatesTo3MessageSystem()`**: Properly applies context updates to truncated messages
- **Maintained framework integration**: Respects `deletedRange` parameter and existing truncation logic
- **Preserved context history updates**: Duplicate file read notices and truncation markers are still applied
- **Updated console logging**: Shows "3-message system" with correct role order

## Expected Benefits
- External request processor now receives only latest turn instead of full conversation
- Dramatically reduced context window usage while maintaining conversation coherence
- Proper integration with Skyline's context management system
- Context history updates (file read optimizations) still work correctly
- Other components can properly track truncation state

## Files Modified
- `src/core/context/context-management/ContextManager.ts`
  - Fixed `getAndAlterTruncatedMessages()` method implementation
  - Added `applyContextHistoryUpdatesTo3MessageSystem()` helper method
  - Maintained proper framework integration while implementing 3-message truncation

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful with no errors (`npm run check-types`)
- ✅ ESLint passes with no warnings (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Production build completes successfully (`npm run package`)
- ✅ Webview build successful (4.6MB bundle generated)
- ✅ All build artifacts generated correctly
- Ready for runtime testing with external request processor

## Verification
Look for console log: `"SKYLINE: Using optimized 3-message system: X messages, roles: system, user, assistant"`

The external request processor should now consistently receive only the latest conversation turn.
