Welcome to the skyline Prompting Guide! This guide will equip you with the knowledge to write effective prompts and custom instructions, maximizing your productivity with skyline.

## Custom Instructions ⚙️

Think of **custom instructions as skyline's programming**. They define skyline's baseline behavior and are **always "on," influencing all interactions.** Instructions can be broad and abstract, or specific and explicit. You might want skyline to have a unique personality, or produce output in a particular file format, or adhere to certain architectural principles. Custom instructions can standardize skyline's output in ways you define, which is especially valuable when working with others. See the [Enterprise section](../enterprise-solutions/custom-instructions.md) for using Custom Instructions in a team context.\

Custom instructions are powerful for:

-   Enforcing Coding Style and Best Practices: Ensure skyline always adheres to your team's coding conventions, naming conventions, and best practices.
-   Improving Code Quality: Encourage skyline to write more readable, maintainable, and efficient code.
-   Guiding Error Handling: Tell skyline how to handle errors, write error messages, and log information.

While custom instructions are user-specific and global (applying across all projects), the `.skylinerules` file provides **project-specific instructions** that live in your project's root directory. These instructions are automatically appended to your custom instructions and referenced in skyline's system prompt, ensuring they influence all interactions within the project context. This makes it an excellent tool for:

### General Use Cases

The `.skylinerules` file is excellent for:

-   Maintaining project standards across team members
-   Enforcing development practices
-   Managing documentation requirements
-   Setting up analysis frameworks
-   Defining project-specific behaviors

### Example .skylinerules Structure

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /docs/adr for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Database schema changes
    Follow template in /docs/adr/template.md

## Code Style & Patterns

-   Generate API clients using OpenAPI Generator
-   Use TypeScript axios template
-   Place generated code in /src/generated
-   Prefer composition over inheritance
-   Use repository pattern for data access
-   Follow error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts

## Testing Standards

-   Unit tests required for business logic
-   Integration tests for API endpoints
-   E2E tests for critical user flows
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Version Controlled**: The `.skylinerules` file becomes part of your project's source code
2. **Team Consistency**: Ensures consistent behavior across all team members
3. **Project-Specific**: Rules and standards tailored to each project's needs
4. **Institutional Knowledge**: Maintains project standards and practices in code

Place the `.skylinerules` file in your project's root directory:

```
your-project/
├── .skylinerules
├── src/
├── docs/
└── ...
```

skyline's system prompt, on the other hand, is not user-editable ([here's where you can find it](https://github.com/skyline/skyline/blob/main/src/core/prompts/system.ts)).

### Tips for Writing Effective Custom Instructions

-   Be Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid ambiguity.
-   Focus on Desired Outcomes: Describe the results you want, not the specific steps.
-   Test and Iterate: Experiment to find what works best for your workflow.

### .skylinerules Folder System 📂

While a single `.skylinerules` file works well for simpler projects, skyline now supports a `.skylinerules` folder for more sophisticated rule organization. This modular approach brings several advantages:

#### How It Works

Instead of a single file, create a `.skylinerules/` directory in your project root:

```
your-project/
├── .skylinerules/              # Folder containing active rules
│   ├── 01-coding.md          # Core coding standards
│   ├── 02-documentation.md   # Documentation requirements
│   └── current-sprint.md     # Rules specific to current work
├── src/
└── ...
```

skyline automatically processes **all Markdown files** inside the `.skylinerules/` directory, combining them into a unified set of rules. The numeric prefixes (optional) help organize files in a logical sequence.

#### Using a Rules Bank

For projects with multiple contexts or teams, maintain a rules bank directory:

```
your-project/
├── .skylinerules/              # Active rules - automatically applied
│   ├── 01-coding.md
│   └── client-a.md
│
├── skylinerules-bank/          # Repository of available but inactive rules
│   ├── clients/              # Client-specific rule sets
│   │   ├── client-a.md
│   │   └── client-b.md
│   ├── frameworks/           # Framework-specific rules
│   │   ├── react.md
│   │   └── vue.md
│   └── project-types/        # Project type standards
│       ├── api-service.md
│       └── frontend-app.md
└── ...
```

#### Benefits of the Folder Approach

1. **Contextual Activation**: Copy only relevant rules from the bank to the active folder
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Update individual rule files without affecting others
3. **Team Flexibility**: Different team members can activate rules specific to their current task
4. **Reduced Noise**: Keep the active ruleset focused and relevant

#### Usage Examples

Switch between client projects:

```bash
# Switch to Client B project
rm .skylinerules/client-a.md
cp skylinerules-bank/clients/client-b.md .skylinerules/
```

Adapt to different tech stacks:

```bash
# Frontend React project
cp skylinerules-bank/frameworks/react.md .skylinerules/
```

#### Implementation Tips

-   Keep individual rule files focused on specific concerns
-   Use descriptive filenames that clearly indicate the rule's purpose
-   Consider git-ignoring the active `.skylinerules/` folder while tracking the `skylinerules-bank/`
-   Create team scripts to quickly activate common rule combinations

The folder system transforms your skyline rules from a static document into a dynamic knowledge system that adapts to your team's changing contexts and requirements.

### Managing Rules with the Toggleable Popover

To make managing both single `.skylinerules` files and the folder system even easier, skyline v3.13 introduces a dedicated popover UI directly accessible from the chat interface.

Located conveniently under the chat input field, this popover allows you to:

-   **Instantly See Active Rules:** View which global rules (from your user settings) and workspace rules (`.skylinerules` file or folder contents) are currently active.
-   **Quickly Toggle Rules:** Enable or disable specific rule files within your workspace `.skylinerules/` folder with a single click. This is perfect for activating context-specific rules (like `react-rules.md` or `memory-bank.md`) only when needed.
-   **Easily Add/Manage Rules:** Quickly create a workspace `.skylinerules` file or folder if one doesn't exist, or add new rule files to an existing folder.

This UI significantly simplifies switching contexts and managing different sets of instructions without needing to manually edit files or configurations during a conversation.

## .skylineignore File Guide

### Overview

The `.skylineignore` file is a project-level configuration file that tells skyline which files and directories to ignore when analyzing your codebase. Similar to `.gitignore`, it uses pattern matching to specify which files should be excluded from skyline's context and operations.

### Purpose

-   **Reduce Noise**: Exclude auto-generated files, build artifacts, and other non-essential content
-   **Improve Performance**: Limit the amount of code skyline needs to process
-   **Focus Attention**: Direct skyline to relevant parts of your codebase
-   **Protect Sensitive Data**: Prevent skyline from accessing sensitive configuration files

### Example .skylineignore File

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
**/node_modules/
.pnp
.pnp.js

# Build outputs
/build/
/dist/
/.next/
/out/

# Testing
/coverage/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Large data files
*.csv
*.xlsx
```

## Prompting skyline 💬

**Prompting is how you communicate your needs for a given task in the back-and-forth chat with skyline.** skyline understands natural language, so write conversationally.

Effective prompting involves:

-   Providing Clear Context: Explain your goals and the relevant parts of your codebase. Use `@` to reference files or folders.
-   Breaking Down Complexity: Divide large tasks into smaller steps.
-   Asking Specific Questions: Guide skyline toward the desired outcome.
-   Validating and Refining: Review skyline's suggestions and provide feedback.

### Prompt Examples

#### Context Management

-   **Starting a New Task:** "skyline, let's start a new task. Create `user-authentication.js`. We need to implement user login with JWT tokens. Here are the requirements…"
-   **Summarizing Previous Work:** "skyline, summarize what we did in the last user dashboard task. I want to capture the main features and outstanding issues. Save this to `skyline_docs/user-dashboard-summary.md`."

#### Debugging

-   **Analyzing an Error:** "skyline, I'm getting this error: \[error message]. It seems to be from \[code section]. Analyze this error and suggest a fix."
-   **Identifying the Root Cause:** "skyline, the application crashes when I \[action]. The issue might be in \[problem areas]. Help me find the root cause and propose a solution."

#### Refactoring

-   **Improving Code Structure:** "skyline, this function is too long and complex. Refactor it into smaller functions."
-   **Simplifying Logic:** "skyline, this code is hard to understand. Simplify the logic and make it more readable."

#### Feature Development

-   **Brainstorming New Features:** "skyline, I want to add a feature that lets users \[functionality]. Brainstorm some ideas and consider implementation challenges."
-   **Generating Code:** "skyline, create a component that displays user profiles. The list should be sortable and filterable. Generate the code for this component."

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

-   **Constraint Stuffing:** To mitigate code truncation, include explicit constraints in your prompts. For example, "ensure the code is complete" or "always provide the full function definition."
-   **Confidence Checks:** Ask skyline to rate its confidence (e.g., "on a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in this solution?")
-   **Challenge skyline's Assumptions:** Ask “stupid” questions to encourage deeper thinking and prevent incorrect assumptions.

Here are some prompting tips that users have found helpful for working with skyline:
